Convention over Configuration
Grails uses "convention over configuration" to configure itself. This typically means that the name and location of files is used instead of explicit configuration, hence you need to familiarize yourself with the directory structure provided by Grails.
Here is a breakdown and links to the relevant sections:

grails-app - top level directory for Groovy sources
conf - Configuration sources.
controllers - Web controllers - The C in MVC.
domain - The application domain.
i18n - Support for internationalization (i18n).
services - The service layer.
taglib - Tag libraries.
utils - Grails specific utilities.
views - Groovy Server Pages - The V in MVC.
scripts - Gant scripts.
src - Supporting sources
groovy - Other Groovy sources
java - Other Java sources
test - Unit and integration tests.
